# United States of Pizza Data Visualizations

## Project Overview

This project presents two types of data visualizations to explore the popularity of different pizza styles across various regions:

- **Map Visualization**: Showcases data on the most popular pizza types in each state within the United States.
- **Chart Visualization**: Compares the popularity of various pizza types, highlighting the most and least popular choices in each country.

## Data Sources

The visualizations are based on two manually curated CSV files containing the following data:

1. The number of states that favor a specific style of pizza.
2. The preferred style of pizza in each state.

I used the following website to get the data: [Eat This, Not That](https://www.eatthis.com/most-popular-pizza-every-state/)

## Tools Used

- [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/): An online tool used to create and embed the data visualizations within the project.
